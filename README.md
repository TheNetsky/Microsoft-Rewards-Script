# Microsoft-Rewards-Script
Automated Microsoft Rewards script, however this time using TypeScript, Cheerio and Playwright.

Under development, however mainly for personal use!

## How to setup ##
1. Download or clone source code
2. Run `npm i` to install the packages
3. Change `accounts.example.json` to `accounts.json` and add your account details
4. Change `config.json` to your liking
5. Run `npm run build` to build the script
6. Run `npm run start` to start the built script

## Notes ##
- If you end the script without closing the browser window first (only with headless as false), you'll be left with hanging chrome instances using resources. Use taskmanager to kill these or use the included `npm run kill-chrome-win` script. (Windows)
- If you automate this script, set it to run at least 2 times a day to make sure it picked up all tasks, set `"runOnZeroPoints": false` so it doesn't run when no points are found.

## Docker (Experimental) ##
### **Before Starting**

- If you had previously built and run the script locally, **remove** the `/node_modules` and `/dist` folders from your `Microsoft-Rewards-Script` directory.
- If you had used Docker with an older version of the script (e.g., 1.4), **remove** any persistently saved `config.json` and session folders. Old `accounts.json` files can be reused.

### **Setup the Source Files**

1. **Download the Source Code**

2. **Update `accounts.json`**

3. **Edit `config.json`,** ensuring the following values are set (other settings are up to your preference):

   ```json
   "headless": true,
   "clusters": 1,
   ```

### **Customize the `compose.yaml` File**

A basic docker `compose.yaml` is provided. Follow these steps to configure and run the container:

1. **Set Your Timezone:** Adjust the `TZ` variable to ensure correct scheduling.
2. **Configure Persistent Storage:**
   - Map `config.json` and `accounts.json` to retain settings and accounts.
   - (Optional) Use a persistent `sessions` folder to save login sessions.
3. **Customize the Schedule:**
   - Modify `CRON_SCHEDULE` to set run times. Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) for help.
   - **Note:** The container adds 5â€“50 minutes of random variability to each scheduled start time.
4. **(Optional) Run on Startup:**
   - Set `RUN_ON_START=true` to execute the script immediately when the container starts.
5. **Start the Container:** Run `docker compose up -d` to build and launch.
6. **Monitor Logs:** Use `docker logs microsoft-rewards-script` to view script execution and to retrieve 'passwordless' login codes.
