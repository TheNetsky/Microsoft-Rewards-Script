# Microsoft-Rewards-Script
Automated Microsoft Rewards script, however this time using TypeScript, Cheerio and Playwright.

Under development, however mainly for personal use!

## How to setup ##
1. Download or clone source code
2. Run `npm i` to install the packages
3. Change `accounts.example.json` to `accounts.json` and add your account details
4. Change `config.json` to your liking
5. Run `npm run build` to build the script
6. Run `npm run start` to start the built script

## Notes ##
- If you end the script without closing the browser window first (only with headless as false), you'll be left with hanging chrome instances using resources. Use taskmanager to kill these or use the included `npm run kill-chrome-win` script. (Windows)
- If you automate this script, set it to run at least 2 times a day to make sure it picked up all tasks, set `"runOnZeroPoints": false` so it doesn't run when no points are found.

## Docker (Experimental) ##
**Note:** If you had previously built and run the script locally, remove the `/node_modules` and `/dist` from your Microsoft-Rewards-Script folder.

1. Download the source code
2. Make changes to your `accounts.json` and `config.json`
3. **Headless mode must be enabled.** You can do this in `config.json` or by using the `HEADLESS=true` environmental variable in docker run or docker compose.yaml (see below). Environmental variables are prioritized over the values in config.json. 
4. The container has in-built scheduling. Customize your schedule using the `CRON_START_TIME` environmental variable. Use [crontab.guru](crontab.guru) if you're unsure how to create a cron schedule.
5. **Note:** the container will add between 5 and 50 minutes of randomized variability to your scheduled start times. 

### Option 1: build and run with docker run

1. Build or re-build the container image with: `docker build -t microsoft-rewards-script-docker .` 

2. Run the container with:

   ```bash
   docker run --name netsky -d \
   -e TZ=America/New_York \
   -e HEADLESS=true \
   -e RUN_ON_START=true \
   -e CRON_START_TIME="0 5,11 * * *" \
   microsoft-rewards-script-docker
   ```
   
3. Optionally, customize your config by adding any other environmental variables from the table below.

4. You can view logs with `docker logs netsky`.

### Option 2: use docker compose

1. A basic docker compose.yaml has been provided. 

2. Optionally, customize your config by adding any other environmental variables from the table below.

3. Build and start the container using `docker compose up -d`.  

4. You can view logs with `docker logs netsky`
